This project is the sole property of Ghazali (aka GShacklebolt) and Md Kasif (aka Kashif Morningstar). 
We have created a system for platform ticket e-booking with hopes to eliminate the need to stand in long queues. 
The name of our project is a portmanteau of the words Queue + Eradicate: Quedicate.

The QR Code generator is based on a Github project which is a copyright of Dominik Dzienia which itself is pure-php
LGPL-licensed implementation based on C libqrencode by Kentaro Fukuchi.
